        \n
        Computers understand instructions that are written in a specific syntactical form called a programming language. A programming language provides a way for a programmer to express a task so that it could be understood and executed by a computer. Refer our another blog-post \"https://hackr.io/blog/what-is-programming-language\" to know more about programming languages. Some of the popular Programming languages are Python, C, C++, Java, etc.

        <b>Why should you learn Computer Programming?</b>
        \n
        Now, after knowing so many things about programming, the big question to be answered is - why should you learn Computer Programming? Let us understand why:
        \n
        <b>Programming is fun:</b> Using Programming, you can create your own games, your personal blog/profile page, a social networking site like Facebook, a search engine like Google or an e-commerce platform like Amazon! Won\’t that be fun? Imagine creating your own game and putting it on Play Store and getting thousands and thousands of downloads!
        \n
        <b>The backbone of a Technology Company:</b>  The backbones of today\’s technology companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and many others, are giant computer programs written by a collaboration of thousands of skilled programmers. If you have the right business acumen, knowing programming can help you create the next big tech company.
        \n
        <b>Pretty good salary:</b> Computer Programmers are paid extremely well almost all across the world. Top programmers in Silicon Valley make millions of dollars every year. Quite a few companies offer to start salaries as high as $100,000 per year.

        <b> C++ </b>
        \n
        The C++ Programming Language is a computer programming book first published in October 1985. It was the first book to describe the C++ programming language, written by the language\'s creator, Bjarne Stroustrup. In the absence of an official standard, the book served for several years as the de factor documentation for the evolving C++ language, until the release of the ISO/IEC 14882:1998: Programming Language C++ standard on 1 September 1998. As the standard further evolved with the standardization of language and library extensions and with the publication of technical corrigenda, later editions of the book were updated to incorporate the new changes.
